The challenge:

Imagine your team has developed a web service that receives requests from about 20 million unique IP addresses every day. You want to keep track of the IP addresses that are making the most requests to your service each day. Your job is to write a program that (1) tracks these IP addresses in memory (don't use a database), and (2) returns the 100 most common IP addresses.



In the language of your choice, please implement these functions:



requestHandled(String ipAddress)

This function accepts a string containing an IP address like "145.87.2.109". This function will be called by the web service every time it handles a request. The calling code is outside the scope of this project (donâ€™t implement the web service). Since it is being called very frequently, this function needs to run fast.



top100()

This function should return the top 100 IP addresses, sorted by request count, with the highest traffic IP address first. This function also needs to run fast. Imagine it needs to provide a quick response (< 300ms) to display on a dashboard, even with 20 millions IP addresses. Don't forget to satisfy this speed requirement.



clear()

Called at the start of each day to forget about all IP addresses and tallies.



Please provide a short written description of your approach (like a PR description) that explains:

* How does your code work?

* What is the runtime complexity of each function?

* What other approaches did you decide not to pursue?

* How would you test this?
